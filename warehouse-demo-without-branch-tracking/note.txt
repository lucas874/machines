add field lbje to mechanism
pass lbje to shouldEventBeEnqued??
update accordingly if enqued??
mechanism protocol should know of branching and joining events as well...?


is this too invasive in machine runner better if just done as part of extended machine business logic??



Argument of type '(a: any, b: any, c: any) => void' is not assignable to parameter of type
'ReactionHandler<[ActyxEvent<MachineEvent<"partID", PartIDPayload>>], ReactionContext<{ id: string; }>, void>'.

'ReactionHandler<[ActyxEvent<>], ReactionContext<{ id: string; }>, void>'.
