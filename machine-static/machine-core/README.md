# Machine Core

Types and utilities used by [machine-check](../machine-check) and [machine-runner](../../machine-runner/) as well as functions for *automatically* generating well-formed subscriptions and adapting machines to composed swarms.
This library exposes an API for composing swarms implemented using [machine-runner](../../machine-runner/). An example use of this API is given [here](../../machine-runner/#composing-swarms).
